# Assembler Chat

This is a chat app that also interprets inline assembler code and visusalises
the machine state alongside. Actually it doesn't do that last bit yet! But it
will within a few hours.

## Quickstart

```bash
bundle install

# Run the tests (rspec, cucumber, teaspoon)
./test.sh

# Run the server
rails s
open http://localhost:3000/
```
